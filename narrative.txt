Before embarking on your first recce mission, you carefully check over your lunar buggy to ensure that it is in top working order. You start by checking the pressure of the nitrogen gas in the tires, making sure that they are properly inflated to handle the rough terrain of the moon's surface. Next, you inspect the buggy's propulsion system, checking the hydrogen fuel levels and making sure that the ion engines are in good working order. Once you are satisfied that everything is in good condition, you climb into the buggy and strap yourself in, eager to begin your journey. You take a moment to adjust the buggy's inertial navigation system and long-range radio, making sure that they are both properly calibrated and ready to go. With everything in place, you start the engines and set off on your first recce mission, ready to explore the mysteries of this strange new world.
